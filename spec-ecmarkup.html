  <h1>RegExp.escape ( S ) </h1>

  <p>`escape` takes a string S and returns a version of it with all control characters escaped. It escapes characters that would otherwise be treated by the regular expressions engine as special meta characters such as `^ $ \ . * + ? ( ) [ ] { } |` using an escape sequence character.</p>
  

  <p>When the `escape` function is called with an argument _S_ the following steps are taken:</p>

  <emu-alg>
    1. Let _str_ be ToString(_S_).
    1. ReturnIfAbrupt(_str_).
    1. Let _cpList_ be a List containing in order the code points as defined in 6.1.4 of _str_, starting at the first element of _str_.
    1. Let _cuList_ be a new List
    1. For each code point _c_ in _cpList_ in List order, do:
      1. If _c_ is a SyntaxCharacter then do:
        1. Append *\* to _cuList_.
      1. Append _c_ to _cuList_.
    1. Let _L_ be a String whose elements are, in order, the elements of _cuList_. 
    1. Return _L_.
  </emu-alg>

  <p>The `length` property of the `escape` method is *1*.</p>

 <emu-note>
    <p>`escape` takes a string and escapes it so it can be literally represented as a pattern. In contrast EscapeRegExpPattern (as the name implies) takes a pattern and escapes it so that it can be represented as a string. While the two are related they do not share the same character escape set or perform similar actions.</p>
